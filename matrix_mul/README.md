### Troubleshooting

**CUDA Architecture Issues:**
If you encounter "Unsupported gpu architecture" errors:

```bash
# Auto-detect (recommended)
cmake -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=native ..

# Manual specification
cmake -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=75 ..  # RTX 20 series
cmake -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=80 ..  # A100/RTX 30 series

# Check your GPU
nvidia-smi --query-gpu=name,compute_cap --format=csv
```

## Implementation Details

### Optimization Techniques

This project implements **only the optimizations that work** on modern hardware:

#### 1. Shared Memory Tiling (Primary Optimization)
**File**: `matrix_mul_original` kernel

**Implementation**:
```cuda
__shared__ float tile_A[TILE_SIZE][TILE_SIZE];
__shared__ float tile_B[TILE_SIZE][TILE_SIZE];

// Load tiles cooperatively
// Compute using shared memory
// Synchronize threads
```

**Why it works**:
- Reduces global memory accesses by 10-50x
- Improves memory locality and cache utilization
- **Most important GPU optimization technique**
- Foundation for all advanced GPU computing

#### 2. Loop Unrolling (Compiler Assistance)
**File**: `matrix_mul_unrolled` kernel

**Implementation**:
```cuda
#pragma unroll
for (int k = 0; k < TILE_SIZE; k++) {
    result += tile_A[threadIdx.y][k] * tile_B[k][threadIdx.x];
}
```

**Why it's included**:
- Demonstrates compiler optimization directives
- Shows how to assist compiler code generation
- Minimal complexity with educational value
- **Realistic impact**: <5% improvement on modern GPUs

**Key Insight**: This project focuses on optimizations that actually work in practice on modern hardware.

### Memory Access Patterns

#### Global Memory Optimization
- **Coalesced Access**: Threads in a warp access consecutive memory locations
- **Cache Utilization**: Optimizes L1/L2 cache usage patterns
- **Bandwidth Efficiency**: Maximizes memory throughput

#### Shared Memory Usage
- **Tile Size**: 16x16 balances data reuse and occupancy
- **Bank Conflicts**: Careful indexing avoids shared memory bank conflicts
- **Synchronization**: Strategic use of `__syncthreads()` for correctness

## Performance Analysis

### Realistic Results

**Modern CUDA Development Reality:**

| Implementation | Time (ms) | Speedup | Notes |
|----------------|-----------|---------|-------|
| **Original Tiled** | 1.037 | Baseline | Excellent shared memory optimization |
| **Loop Unrolled** | 1.036 | ~0.1% | Minimal improvement - compiler already optimizes |
| **cuBLAS SGEMM** | 0.114 | **9x faster** | Professional optimization target |

### Why Improvements Are Small

#### Modern GPU Architecture Efficiency
- **Automatic Coalescing**: GPUs automatically optimize memory access patterns
- **Advanced Caching**: L1/L2 caches hide much memory latency
- **Compiler Maturity**: NVCC already applies many optimizations automatically

#### When Manual Optimizations Matter
- **Older GPU Architectures**: Pre-Pascal GPUs benefit more from manual optimizations
- **Memory-Bound Kernels**: When arithmetic intensity is very low
- **Specific Use Cases**: Certain data patterns or sizes may benefit more
- **Extreme Performance Requirements**: When every microsecond counts

### cuBLAS Dominance

**Why cuBLAS is 9x faster:**
- **Vendor Optimizations**: Uses architecture-specific instructions and layouts
- **Advanced Techniques**: Implements optimizations beyond educational examples
- **Years of Tuning**: Highly optimized for specific hardware configurations
- **Professional Development**: Full-time teams optimizing for each GPU generation

## Key Learning Points

### Primary Lessons

1. **Shared Memory Tiling is King**: The most important GPU optimization technique
2. **Modern Hardware is Smart**: Many manual optimizations are unnecessary
3. **Micro-optimizations Have Limits**: Often provide <10% improvements
4. **Professional Libraries Win**: cuBLAS represents years of expert optimization
5. **Algorithm Changes Matter More**: High-level optimizations often more impactful

### Memory Hierarchy Understanding

#### Global Memory
- **Minimize Accesses**: Use shared memory as cache
- **Maximize Coalescing**: Ensure threads access consecutive addresses
- **Bandwidth Bound**: Often the limiting factor in GPU kernels

#### Shared Memory
- **Fast Cache**: ~100x faster than global memory
- **Bank Conflicts**: Avoid simultaneous access to same bank
- **Limited Size**: Balance tile size with occupancy

#### Registers
- **Fastest Storage**: Directly accessible by threads
- **Spilling Costs**: Too many registers force spills to local memory
- **Occupancy Impact**: Register usage affects thread block scheduling

### Architecture Considerations

- **Warp Size**: 32 threads execute in lockstep
- **Thread Divergence**: Branching within warps reduces efficiency
- **Occupancy**: Balance resource usage for maximum throughput
- **Compute Capability**: Different optimizations work better on different architectures

## Advanced Topics

### Testing Different Matrix Sizes

```bash
# Small matrices (512x512)
cmake -DMATRIX_SIZE=512 .. && make && ./matrix_mul_optimized

# Large matrices (2048x2048)

# Extra large matrices (4096x4096)
cmake -DMATRIX_SIZE=4096 .. && make && ./matrix_mul_optimized
```

### Profiling and Analysis

```bash
# Profile with nvprof

### Accuracy Verification

The program includes comprehensive testing:
- Compares GPU results against CPU reference implementation
- Reports elements with errors exceeding threshold (ε = 1e-5)
- Displays maximum error found
- Ensures optimizations don't compromise correctness

### Further Optimizations

**Techniques worth exploring for advanced users:**
- **Tensor Cores**: Mixed-precision computation on newer GPUs
- **Cooperative Groups**: More flexible thread synchronization
- **Multi-GPU**: Scaling across multiple devices
- **Mixed Precision**: Using FP16 for higher throughput
- **Persistent Kernels**: Reducing kernel launch overhead
